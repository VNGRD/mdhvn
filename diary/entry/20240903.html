  <p>Testing out <a href="https://github.com/deadlyjack/Acode" target="_blank">Acode</a> on my phone. I think I can use this as a way to add entries to my site even though I don't have my laptop readily available with me, which is pretty neat. I literally started working on this while I was on my lunch break at work so that's cool! That said, I don't know if I'll be doing anything <i>heavy</i> and just use this as more of an on-the-go kinda thing. Having tried it on my tablet though, it does work really nicely.</p>
  <p>Anyways, I've been having that urge to switch up my layout completely. Again. I think I'll stay resolute on keepong with what I have right now though, since this site is very much built with only my most basic of HTML/CSS knowledge and I haven't picked up on my self-studies <i>beyond</i> the basics in forever. I also want to keep things as simple as possible for my own sanity until I do know more, and I really do appreciate the simplicity of it all. For some reason, along the way while working on this site, I decided to stay away from JavaScript, at least with this iteration. The name of the game really is to keep it simple, I guess. I still do love what I have - I think what I'm experiencing here is a "the grass is greener on the other side" moment.</p>
  <p>Now, what would be an efficient way to get this to my repository... I'll probably update this page once I figure something out.</p>
  <p><b>Update:</b></p>
  <p>There is no efficiency and it's terrible. Git as far as I know isn't workable on Android (unless there's an Acode plugin available), so I have to manually copy and paste between Acode and the Github app to add/update pages ;-; Unless there actually is a Git plugin, I'm for sure not gonna do anything too crazy with Acode until I figure something out.</p>
