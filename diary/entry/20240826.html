  <p>I've been scrolling through 32-bit cafe's <a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49" target="_blank">list of blogging platforms</a> instead of, you know, doing other things that I should be doing, like showering and sleeping. Whilst scrolling through the different blogging services offered, one thought occurred to me over and over again: can't I just do it all myself? Well, when I was watching the <a href="https://zonelets.net/posts/2020-11-08-Quick-Start-Guide" target="_blank">zonelets quick start guide</a>, I was kind of right in that I can just do all that myself. Of course, it doesn't come with cool neat features and stuff, and all I'm really doing is continuing to make pages from scratch, but then again, that's always what I've been doing.</p> 
  <p>And to be honest, I kind of don't like having my long thought-out posts in a kind of feed, which was why I liked <a href="https://www.schlaugh.com/~posts" target="_blank">schlaugh</a>, since you had to really actively search for me there to even see what I was posting. (Here he is again, the hermit that wants to be left alone online all the time!!) Although I will say, I did finally make a <a href="https://status.cafe/users/mdhvn" target="_blank">status.cafe</a> acc after much deliberation, and I'm really liking it so far. I'm not sure if that's the most I'll do in terms of stepping outside my comfort zone, per se, but we'll see. I do really love it as an alternative to what a certain hellsite used to be.</p>
  <p>Anyways, it's ironic, don't you think? Those that actively participate in the old web encourage reaching out to others, except I'm doing the exact opposite of that because I'm [checks notes] Too Shy Online. I feel like some sort of antithesis to it all - the community, I mean. I participate, but only do so in this small corner of mine, and I honestly do like it that way. I dunno. We'll see. Maybe. Yep. Okay I think I'm gonna go do the things I need to do now actually ok bye</p>
