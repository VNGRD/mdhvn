  <p><i>this is basically copy-pasted from my <a href="https://war-saint.tumblr.com/post/781924280279744512/this-tier-maker-looked-fun-so-i-decided-to-do-it" target="_blank">tumblr post</a>. i just wanted to throw it in here for archival purposes. enjoy!</i></p>
  <br>
  <p>this <a href="https://t.co/NaeP64KRdr" target="_blank">tier maker</a> fun so i decided to do it for rune through his lore and not necessarily gameplay and what i have leveled for him.</p>
  <p>(it's still funny bc he is indeed an extension of me, and therefore a lot of choices that i make in picking which job to level also basically more or less goes in line with what he would pick.)</p>
  <img style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/333ce14fd18bac8ad0127dd2a20d68da/704773f037a81789-71/s1280x1920/44c11f8f83e84b8c2528c86376809c4b0b9bf96e.png">
  <p>much of his skill set lies in the art of war, specifically melee combat. therefore what he has learned in one job is translatable to him in others. that is the main reason for much of the jobs in the competent category. the only reason why ninja is the only melee job in competent and not skilled is due its specific mechanics with mudras. if you asked him to pick up knives, he would purely fight as if he were a rogue only.</p>
  <p>his competency with warrior is situational - as in, when ardbert is the one driving his body around for the day. otherwise, he would be closer to unskilled with the axe due to the weapon not being a pure blade easily wielded like paladin.</p>
  <p>in terms of healing, he only shows competency because of possible training he received from axilia and the healer scions. it’s not something he would actively pick to use, however. at the very least, he has that knowledge as needed for dire situations. scholar is in the unskilled category due to more advanced knowledge needed to properly heal with it that he lacks the proper education for.</p>
  <p>he is completely unskilled in dps casters purely because he wants to get up close and personal with his enemies. he has more competency with physical ranged dps with the archery training he received as a child, and uses those same principles for dancer and machinist. he still prefers to be in melee range in fights though.</p>
  <p>(hilariously, he shows insane promise with a gun, and that’s only because the original version of him as an oc is incredibly skilled with guns, specifically pistols and sniper rifles. he is banned from it in xiv because dsr would end up being canon if he had access to a gun.)</p>
  <p>the master and skilled categories are jobs he has more dedicated training with. he showed promise as a dark knight during his search to balance the light and dark within him, and effectively uses his emotions to power his combat. for gunbreaker, he became interested in thancred’s fighting style, and decided to ask about it one day and received training for it as a result. as a child, he was taught to fight hand-to-hand combat in the event that he loses his weapon, and he also became sparring partners with lyse in this area. and, similarly with thancred, he learned and trained for a while with hien and gosetsu when he showed interest in their fighting style as samurai. this was during a time when his previous cherished lance was broken, and he kept continuously breaking his weapon despite axilia's best efforts to repair or craft new ones for him. his skill as a monk came from his years of practicing and sparring with lyse in hand to hand combat, since the beginning of a realm reborn.</p>
  <p>when he found that being a dark knight isn’t quite helping balance out his light and dark aether, that’s when he learned about reapers and their pacts with voidsent. this was a great solution to keep the balance whilst ardbert helped keep the light at bay. he easily becomes a master of the job as a result, but he does not put as much time and effort into it as he does with his dragoon skills.</p>
  <p>he is only a master of fishing purely because the activity brings him peace. and then he started catching weird ass rare fish and people started taking notice.</p>
  <p>he is a grandmaster for dragoon for obvious reasons. the lance is what he chose to wield ever since he was young, and he will most likely die with it either of old age or through battle. if it meant that he wasn’t going to be fucking around, you will see him with his lance. he is constant sparring partners with estinien here. it certainly helps when your partner is also a dragoon so you both can continuously sharpen each other’s skills.</p>
  <p>for the dol/doh jobs: he has competency with both culinarian and botanist through his warder training. from a young age, he learned how to properly forage and hunt, and to make food out of it. for everything else, i don’t think he even realizes there are people eager to train him with their arts. he’s lived his life too much as a fighter to learn so. unfortunately, with his monetary habits as well as his refusal to pick a dedicated craft outside of fighting, he is constantly lacking money, and only makes gil through jobs through the adventurer's guild.</p>
