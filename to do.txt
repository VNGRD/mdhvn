thoughtstream (stuff from schlaugh, probably)
art/portfolio
toyhou.se-like page for my ocs?
notebook (writing, snippets)
WOL/FFXIV GALLERY! https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_image_gallery.asp
general game screenshot gallery maybe?
now page https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog

no garden actually. just keep it up in quartz. the speed at which i make notes + the backlog i have to port is going to be annoying
