    <p>It’s really interesting how much I have subscribed to the idea of the cozy web without even knowing specifically about it – then again, I am of the demographic that the term is targeted to. I’d argue that, for me personally, I go beyond the “cozy web” and go for “cozy tech” in general that also takes in the ideas of the cozy web.</p>
