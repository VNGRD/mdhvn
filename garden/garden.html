    <p>welcome! this is basically a simple, hypertext version of my <a href="https://sprout.pages.dev/">digital garden</a> :^) i made this as bare-bones as can be, inspired by the old web and especially <a href="https://nightfall.city/">nightfall city</a>. enjoy your visit!</a></p>
    
    <br>

    <p><u><b>current topics of interest</b></u>:</p>
    <ol>1. learning html and css</ol>
    <ol>2. web revival and my personal relationship with technology</ol>
    <ol>3. digital gardening - how it works, how it makes people think, and how it can work for me personally (this thing!)</ol>
    <ol>4. ffxiv - writing and lorebuilding centered around my wol, rune. heavy spoilers abound for up to 7.0 :^)</ol>

    <p>as this is intended to be an online version of my obsidian vault that i primarily use for learning, notetaking, and creative writing, the sources that i may use for my studies will usually be listed at the bottom of my notes for my own personal reference, and my citations, if done at all, may be academically incorrect. please think of this garden as someone's class notes you may have found left in a table of a cafe and not as a source used for actual academic writing. thank you ^^</p>
