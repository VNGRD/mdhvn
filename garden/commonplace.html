    <blockquote>
        <p>"what is it that the child has to teach?</p>
        <p>The child naively believes that everything should be fair and everyone should be honest, that only good should prevail, that everybody should have what they want and there should be no pain or sadness. The child believes the world should be perfect and is outraged to discover it is not.</p>
        <p>And the child is right.”</p>
