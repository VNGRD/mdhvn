  <p><i>some of my favorite places on the web!</i></p>
  <br>

  <p><b>cool websites by other people:</b></p>
  <li><a href="https://nightfall.city/" target="_blank">nightfall.city</a> >> this site is so wonderfully atmospheric to me, in the sense that it's both very old web and that the writing in here easily takes you to places in your mind. it's the main inspiration for this site!</li>
  <li><a href="https://xandra.cc" target="_blank">museum of alexandra</a> >> another personal site that i really love! i found it whilst in my foray into the old web and neocities sites.</li>
  <li><a href="https://melonking.net/" target="_blank">melonking.net</a> >> a great resource and awesome example of an old web-style site! just watch out for flashing images if you're susceptible to that kind of stuff.</li>
