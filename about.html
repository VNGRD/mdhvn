  <h3>about me :^)</h3>

  <h3>so what's with the personal site anyway?</h3>
  <p>easy! here are several reasons why, kept simple:</p>
  <br>
  <li>1. i'm sick and tired of the state of social media in the internet</li>
  <li>2. i hate how in such sites, you're not able to express yourself anymore, and what you can do is marginal at best</li>
  <li>3. i absolutely adore the old web and wanted to add to it with my own little site</li>
  <li>4. having something like this feels more permanent compared to a social media account that can be taken down at any time</li>
  <li>5. this acts as a different kind of creative outlet for me personally!</li>
  <li>6. also it's really cool to have your own domain. cooler than getting your own username in a social media website bc you can do so many things with a domain! like hey look at this cool thing i've built from the ground up!!</li>
  <br>

  <h3>socials and other things(oh the irony)</h3>
  <br>

  <ul><a href="https://steelhazes.tumblr.com" target="_blank">tumblr</a>. if this site dies don't expect to find me anywhere else anymore LOL</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MDHVN/" target="_blank">steam</a>. uhhh don't look at the game collection section THANK YOU</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://www.schlaugh.com/mdhvn" target="_blank">schlaugh</a>. a site i found during my initial foray into the old web. i use it mostly for web-related ramblings while i learn web development and such, but i'll probably end up moving my thoughts from there to somewhere in here. yippee</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://sprout.pages.dev" target="_blank">my digital garden</a>! built using <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/" target="_blank">quartz</a> and based in <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">obsidian</a>. this is kind of like my online five-star subject notebook on steroids. contains a whole bunch of nonsense, like my personal learning notes into web development mixed unceremoniously with creative writing. beware of what you find.</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDHVN" target="_blank">youtube</a>. IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. it's just an archive for game recordings to save on storage space. if you call me a content creator i will vomit</ul>
  <br>

  <h4>dead accounts</h4>
  <p>these are my accounts for these particular sites. they don't see any use anymore and are kept for only username purposes. you will literally find me nowhere else in these sites other than these with accounts - if you somehow do, it's 99% not me.</p>
