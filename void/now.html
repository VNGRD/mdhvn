          <p>waking up with a song on her heart</p>
          <p>to make it clear, i think that we should take it to the start</p>
          <p>walked past an old man laying in the park</p>
          <p>he was talking to himself, but he was saying something sharp</p>
          <p>she found herself drawn to the vibe of his remarks</p>
          <p>the resonations called her like blood to a shark</p>
          <p>but as she got closеr, she felt something dark</p>
          <p>knеw she made a mistake, but before she could depart</p>
          <p>he reached up and grabbed her, sent her pulse off the charts</p>
          <p>said "everything you do will now be in another art"</p>
          <p>then vanished like superman abandoning the planet</p>
          <p>but this was similar to finding land in the atlantic on the low</p>
