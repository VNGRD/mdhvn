  <h3>things that have had a great influence on me as a person (and some of these probably shouldn't have been)</h3>
  <p>this is probably the easiest way to get to know me. after all, i do have this great tendency to make things i am/was fixated with as my personality trait 'v'</p>
  <br>

  <p><u>books</u> >></p>
  <li><b>percy jackson and the olympians</b> >> proud to be an og since the first series <3</li>
  <li><b>daughter of smoke and bone</b> >> fundamentally changed my brain chemistry in high school</li>
  <li><b>the picture of dorian gray</b> >> this one is my pretentious classic book pick. also fundamentally changed my brain chemistry in high school</li>
  <br>

  <p><u>games</u> >></p>
  <li><b>the elder scrolls</b> >> oblivion and skyrim mainly, but 10000% skyrim is my absolute favorite game ever it's not even funny. i was THAT kid that drew the entire skyrim map on my table in class. skyrim is the game i always come back to when i just need <i>something</i>. i have thousands of hours combining my ps3 and pc hours.</li>
  <ul>to that end, <a href="https://sureai.net/games/enderal/" target="_blank">enderal</a> gets a very, <i>very</i> special mention here. if you have skyrim on pc, you have to play this one. it's nothing like skyrim though, and has nothing to do with the elder scrolls franchise at all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xlzVZEkRV0" target="_blank">it's also very, <i>very</i> dark.</a></ul>
  <li><b>final fantasy</b> >> i haven't played the entire franchise - that's way too much money and time to spend - but the ones that have had a great deal of influence on me in my past and now are a handful:</li>
  <ul>>> mainline: vii, xiii, xiv</ul>
  <ul>>> spinoffs: crystal chronicles - echoes of time (ds), dissidia (psp), type-0 (ps3)</ul>
  <li><b>soulsborne</b> >> more specifically, 3 and bloodborne</li>
  <li><b>armored core 6</b> >> I LOVE AC6 SO SO MUCH I WANT TO PLAY THE OTHER AC GAMES SO BAD</li>
  <li><b>monster hunter</b> >> started with freedom unite on the psp, got traumatized by getting attacked by tigrex while minding my business in the snowy mountains, and loved the game from then on. i'm one of those really annoying charge blade mains</li>
  <li><b>minecraft</b></li>
  <li><b>sky: children of the light</b></li>
  <li><b>mother/earthbound</b></li>
  <li><b>rpg maker</b> >> yume nikki, OFF</li>
  <li><b">overwatch</b> >> ONE ONLY. two is dead to me. nyxl married man meta forever </3</li>
  <br><br>

  <p><u>music</u> >></p>
  <p>to be honest, i'm more of a soundtracks kind of person, but there are a handful of artists i have to give kudos to:</p>
  <ul><b>in love with a ghost</b></ul>
  <ul><b>perturbator</b></ul>
  <ul><b>carpenter brut</b></ul>
  <ul><b>dan terminus</b></ul>
  <ul><b>HEALTH</b></ul>
  <ul><b>AURORA</b></ul>
  <ul><b>billie eilish</b></ul>
  <p>yeah i did have a kpop phase:</p>
  <ul><b>VIXX</b> >> the very first group i got into with voodoo doll and error <3</ul>
  <ul><b>EXO</b> >> overdose era was the goat</ul>
  <ul><b>BTS</b> >> started in danger era by watching the mv in my 3ds LMAOO, haven't listened since wings though</ul>
  <p>and in terms of composers:</p>
  <ul><b>hans zimmer</b> >> interstellar</ul>
  <ul><b>yu peng chen</b> >> genshin impact</ul>
  <ul><b>yuka kitamura</b> >> dark souls 3, bloodborne</ul>
  <ul><b>masayoshi soken</b> >> ffxiv</ul>
  <ul><b>masashi hamauzu</b> >> ffxiii</ul>
  <ul><b>ZUN</b> >> touhou</ul>
  <ul><b>jeremy soule</b> >> oblivion, skyrim</ul>
  <ul><b>austin wintory</b> >> absolver, journey, abzu</ul>
  <ul><b>vincent diamante</b> >> sky: children of the light</ul>
  <ul><b>alex roe</b> >> for his soulsborne remixes <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6lozE1XoRut9uzuBYlRQ4e?si=6d25855cb3434ff3" target="_blank">(the profaned vanguard is my all-time favorite!)</a></ul>
  <br>

  <p><u>anime and manga</u> >></p>
  <li><a href="">naruto</a> >> of the "big three" shounen shows at the time, this was the one that i was very much into the most when i was young. can i interest you in some ninja info ca- [gets shot]</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_Peach">wedding peach</a> >> i remember getting the first volume of the manga at a borders when i was small and absolutely loving it. i never watched the anime, but this one was my intro to shoujo stuff (it was never sailor moon sorry buds)</li>
  <li><a href="">death note</a> >> probably should have not been reading this in 5th grade</li>
  <li><a href="">rosario + vampire</a> >> ABSOLUTELY should not have been reading this in 5th grade</li>
  <li><a href="">mirai nikki</a> >> REALLY SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN WATCHING THIS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL</li>

  <h3>so what's with the personal site anyway?</h3>
  <p>here are several reasons why, kept simple:</p>
  <li>1. i'm sick and tired of the state of social media in the internet</li>
  <li>2. i hate how in such sites, you're not able to express yourself anymore, and what you can do is marginal at best</li>
  <li>3. i absolutely adore the old web and wanted to add to it with my own little site</li>
  <li>4. having something like this feels more permanent compared to a social media account that can be taken down at any time</li>
  <li>5. this acts as a different kind of creative outlet for me personally!</li>
  <li>6. also it's really cool to have your own domain. cooler than getting your own username in a social media website bc you can do so many things with a domain! like hey look at this cool thing i've built from the ground up!!</li>

  <h3>socials and other things (oh the irony)</h3>
  <br>

  <ul><a href="https://steelhazes.tumblr.com" target="_blank">tumblr</a>. if this site dies don't expect to find me anywhere else anymore LOL</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MDHVN/" target="_blank">steam</a>. uhhh don't look at the game collection section THANK YOU</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/26708816/" target="_blank">ffxiv lodestone</a>, on the topic of gaming i guess. please invite me to ur static if you need a melee dps main i want to do the savage raids so bad and i dont want to deal with party finder strats PLEASE</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://www.schlaugh.com/mdhvn" target="_blank">schlaugh</a>. a site i found during my initial foray into the old web. i use it mostly for web-related ramblings while i learn web development and such, but i'll probably end up moving my thoughts from there to somewhere in here. yippee</ul>
  <ul><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDHVN" target="_blank">youtube</a>. IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. it's just an archive for game recordings to save on storage space. if you call me a content creator i will vomit</ul>
  <br>

  <h4>dead accounts</h4>
  <p>these are my accounts for these particular sites. they don't see any use anymore and are kept for only username purposes. you will literally find me nowhere else in these sites other than these with accounts - if you somehow do, it's 99% not me.</p>
