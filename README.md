## what dis
- originally used as an exercise to try and turn my quartz-based garden into a purely hypertext website, now converted into just my own personal site instead!
- original release was in [rzy.neocities](https://rzy.neocities.org) but ultimately decided to host it on github instead for easier workflow.
- **not** meant to be polished - inspired by sites on [neocities](https://neocities.org/browse) and especially [nightfall.city](https://nightfall.city).
