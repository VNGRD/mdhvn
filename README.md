## what dis
- a wip exercise in turning my quartz-published garden into something minimal and heavily text-based... that eventually turned into an attempt at combining everything that i am currently using (startpage/garden/memex) into one (hopefully) functional website
- original release was in [neocities](https://rzy.neocities.org) but ultimately decided to host it on github instead for easier workflow

## to-do
- [x] make website color scheme based on a certain... [someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQeTZ4_77PA)
- [x] find a way to make everything properly centered (yk what, i like the off-center version this way)
- [ ] style and fix links in memex + add link back to og repo
- [x] garden footer links
- [x] pixel font? pretty please (jk mincho font is fine)
- [ ] add own art to memex!
- [ ] make a custom 404 page
