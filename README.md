## what dis
- a wip exercise in turning my quartz-published garden into something minimal and heavily text-based... that eventually turned into an attempt at combining everything that i am currently using (startpage/garden/memex) into one (hopefully) functional website
- original release was in [rzy.neocities](https://rzy.neocities.org) but ultimately decided to host it on github instead for easier workflow
- **not** meant to be polished - inspired by sites on [neocities](https://neocities.org/browse) and especially [nightfall.city](https://nightfall.city). also meant to be following heavily on the digital garden ethos

## to-do
- [ ] style and fix links in memex + add link back to og repo
- [ ] make a custom 404 page
- [ ] theme switcher
- [ ] about/now page
- [ ] art page
