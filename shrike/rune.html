    <p>A friend to nature, a foe to those that dare being innocents, friends, and family to harm... and he strikes back at them with what one can call a surgical bloodthirst; a kind of storm beneath calm waters condensed into the deadly point of his spear.</p>
    <p>Melee combat is his specialty, and he is very, *very* good at it. He gives credit to his abilities to his former Wood Warder master, who had a strong emphasis in combat during his training.</p>
    <p>In the battlefield, people would describe him as a controlled chaos. His strikes are deliberate and precise, but he does so in blindingly fast fashion that this enemies are left to wonder what the hell just happened before they are cut to pieces.</p>

    <p><b>a tranquil spirit >></b></p>
    <p>Outside of battle and in places he deems safe, he lets down his guard and generally is calm, tranquil, and gentle. He loves to take naps under the shade of trees, as it reminds him of the forest he once called home. His demeanor makes it so that he is easily approachable by animals. It's not unusual to find him napping beneath a tree with a bird trying to nest in his long hair.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>introverted hero >></b></p> 
    <p>He does tend to keep to himself and honestly prefers it that way, which makes him feel very ill-suited for the more political side of things that the scions get involved with. He's just glad that the others are there to do the talking, as he would rather be pointed as a weapon toward the enemy instead.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>frosted bloodlust >></b></p>
    <p>During battle, it would be a wonder to get any words out of him if you were his enemy. His attitude becomes one of frostbite - silent and poised to kill. Underneath the calm, he has a thirst for battle and bloodshed that can be rather frightening to others, even his comrades. His guilty pleasure is the thrill of dancing with death - nothing makes him feel both more alive and more appreciative of the world around him, and it makes him more protective of life as a whole. At one point (during Stomblood), this becomes dangerously close to a kind of self-harm, to the point that Aymeric had to stage an intervention at the behest of the Scions. At the same time, this bloodthirst is what draws Zenos towards him, and as a result he further enables that side of him. Interestingly, he does not mind being dehumanized and being used as a weapon and a weapon only, partly due to the way he was raised and his love for fighting.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>the mind of a protector >></b></p>
    <p>Some would say that his behavior with which he readily throws himself into harm’s way for the sake of others is befitting as his role as the Warrior of Light, but when one decides to look into it a little further, the behavior quickly becomes concerning. This is both due to his yearning for battle and his belief that you must go the distance in order to protect those you love; however, he truly takes this to a drastic length to the point of near-martyrdom. His tendency to put everything and everyone before himself manifests into such behavior as a result.</p>
    <p>From a conversation regarding Rune's habits and tendencies:</p>
    <ul>T: <i>maybe just like the pattern is like jumping into things without regard if he comes out alive. like everyone knows the stakes of it all but rune knows it and just jumps anyways while everyone hesitates.</i></ul>
    <ul>A: <i>yea i think that would be a good way to go about it! like with the primals everyone is initially thinking like “oh he’s so brave for that” but when the enemies scale even further in terms of power she’s like “now wait a minute. hold on there bud. did you even plan to come out of that one alive”</i></ul>
