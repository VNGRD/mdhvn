    <h2><section id="key points">key points and characterization</section></h2>
    <p><b>character inspirations >></b> raiden ei (gnsn), xie lian (hob), acheron (hsr)</p>
    <p><b>keywords >></b> persistent, gentle, deadly</p>
    <p>A friend to nature, a foe to those that dare being innocents, friends, and family to harm... and he strikes back at them with what one can call a surgical bloodthirst; a kind of storm beneath calm waters condensed into the deadly point of his spear.</p>
    <p>Melee combat is his specialty, and he is very, very good at it. He gives credit to his abilities to his former Wood Warder master, who had a strong emphasis in combat during his training; but even so, much of his ability with melee weaponry is rather prodiguous, which ends up being one of the many things that draws Zenos towards him.</p>
    <p>Inside the battlefield, people would describe him as a controlled chaos. His strikes are deliberate and precise, but he does so in blindingly fast fashion that this enemies are left to wonder what the hell just happened before they are cut to pieces.</p>
    <p>Outside the battlefield, he is known to be reserved but always willing to help those in need. Only a few people are able to unravel a more open side to him, even amongst the Scions. Hardly anyone knows his true history either, but he does prefer to keep it that way due to some sort of paranoia that he would be found by his childhood captors once more. This quickly becomes irrelevant when his status as a Warrior of Light begins to spread across the star.</p>
    <p><b>dialogue and inflections >></b> this section draws from <a href="https://cereovo.tumblr.com/post/746509825351057408/i-made-my-own-oc-meme-the-goal-is-to-encourage" target="_blank">this</a> oc dialogue meme!</p>
    <p>He would not really be the kind to introduce himself first and instead be introduced by others. Generally, he shows up for the job, and leaves the talking to others. If he <i>had</i> to introduce himself, though, the most he might do is give a nod and say, "Rune." That's it. This guy is the dictionary definition of a man of a few words.</p>
    <p>Rune's voice is more on the monotone side, with not much emotion poured into it until it's felt so strongly that it bleeds into his tone. Sometimes he speaks so softly that you have to ask him to speak up. Initially, he had his mother tongue's accent, but after his kidnapping, it's something that he intentionally suppresses to not stand out as much. That combined with moving around from place to place to blend in with the populace makes his accent more on the ambiguous side, making him hard to place. In terms of his voice claim, it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJGAWPOaeBU" target="_blank">Howard Yang's performance as Xie Lian in Heaven Official's Blessing!</a></p>
    <ul><b>Swearing >></b> Swearing isn't really found in his vocabulary, but he ia more than capable of doing so - that said, he usually only swears when things are truly dire.</ul>
    <ul><b>Formality vs slang>></b> He lands in the middle of this spectrum. He doesn't really acclimate to slang until he's stayed in one place for a long time. When he <i>does</i> speak in slang, it tends to catch others off guard.</ul>
    <ul><b>Vocabulary >></b> Due to his upbringing, he tends to speak in much simpler terms.</ul>
    <ul><b>Body language >></b> He is definitely not the type to gesture excitedly during conversation. He essentially popularized the iconic head nod throughout the star. It's something the Scions poke fun at him for.</ul>
    <p>Dialogue samples:</p>
    <ul><b>Passionate interest >></b> "Let's spar. There's a nice spot over there for it. ...oh, you mean what I like? ...sometimes, I like to sit under a tree and feel the wind."</ul>
    <ul><b>Insult that hits the mark >></b> <i>He wouldn't really say anything and instead give the offender either an icy stare or a glower depending on his mood. If it was Axilia:</i> "Hey, Ax? Shut up."</ul>
    <ul><b>Caught doing something - can they talk their way out of it? >></b> <i>Most likely not. More often than not, this man is bad at lying due to his more straightforward tendency. That being said, if he was caught doing something in a hostile area, he would definitely not talk and instead head straight to physical violence.</i></ul>
    <ul><b>Free space / dramatic monologue >></b> <i>This man definitely does not monologue, are you kidding?</i></ul>

    <h2><section id="pre-ARR history">pre-ARR history</section></h2>
    <p>Rune is born to a village located in the Skatay Range in southern Othard. For the most part, he lived a rather idyllic childhood but was often found at the edge of the village, watching the tree line as if he was waiting for something. During this time, he was taught how to read, write, and the basics of combat and survival by the women of the village. At one point, he tries to sneak outside but ends up being caught by a Wood Warder and was subsequently punished for it after he was brought back to the village - this was when he learned of the dangers of the outside world and the existence of the Wood Warders.</p>
    <p>Once puberty hit and the roles of the children were to be determined within the village, Rune is AFAB and at first spends the first several months in the village learning the tasks of the village women; and yet, throughout this time, it was clear that he had felt miserable the entire time. He says as much as well to the matriarch, who then tells him that he's not the first one to feel this way and lets him know that it's alright - the only thing was that his role was to be changed to that of a protector of the forest. He eagerly accepts this trade and, after a short treatment with fantasia, begins his forest protector training at the age of 13.</p>
    <p>During this time, Thurin, his Wood Warder master (and, unbeknownst to him, his older brother), teaches him a variety of combat methods, to which it's revealed that Rune has a natural talent for melee combat despite the focus of Warders to stick to the shadows and strike the enemy unnoticed. From there they began his brutal combat training in earnest; to this end, he always gives credit to his master regarding his combat prowess should someone ask.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, his training only lasts for 2 years when, at age 15, a wayward Garlean unit strays into the forest and kills his master in combat. They then kidnap Rune and ship him off to Doma under orders for experimentation overseen by Aulus mal Asina. It would take only a few short months for Rune to escape the facility, however, but not without extra scars in body and mind. This experience would leave him with a deep hatred for Garleans.</p>
    <p>Finding himself unable to return home after his escape, Rune decides to move to Eorzea in a bid to avoid the Garlean presence in Othard, eventually finding himself in Gridania as an adventurer during the Seventh Umbral Calamity.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>the fourteenth seat of the convocation</h3>
    <p>Koronis is the unsundered Ancient in which Rune is a shard of. His name means "crow" - a rather appropriate name, for his hair was intensely dark and notably so.</p>
    <p>As Koronis's counterpart in the Source, it holds that Rune appears to be most like him compared to the rest of the shards. Both share jet black hair and bright gold eyes; they also share the same interest in martial combat, but for the most part, that's where their similarities end.</p>
    <p>In terms of his personality, "sunny" is a great way to put it mildly, and perhaps literally. Some would describe him as if they were staring directly into the sun. He was also rather impulsive and reckless with his methodology, but in the end his ways ended up being rather effective and efficient, much to Emet’s chagrin and Hythlodaeus’s amusement. He was known for being very eager to help others as well, and had a stubborn streak so wide that it was almost, if not all of, the source of Emet’s woes. That being said, he  held so much love for Etheirys and its people, and this made him the perfect candidate as Azem in Venat's eyes.</p>
    <p>(On a more amusing note, one other time Koronis is similar to Rune is when the former frankly shuts up.)</p>
    <p>In the World Unsundered, Koronis had actually shared the seat of Azem with one other; an Ancient that was later found to be Axilia's unsundered soul. Both holders had the unusual quality of their souls in that they were both very nearly identical; the only way to tell them apart was by physical appearance alone. Koronis was more notably outgoing and wore his heart on his sleeve, and he preferred travel and martial combat compared to careful research and study. His counterpart, meanwhile, was the opposite. This would later be an eerie similarity to the Dawnservant's Heads of Reason and Resolve as the leaders of Tural, not to mention Azem's connection with the sun as a whole.</p>
    <small>(Honestly, one can think of Koronis cut from the same cloth as Jake Peralta, but that gives me too much psychic damage to even say those words)</small>
    <br><hr><br>

    <h2><section id="personality">personality</section></h2>
    <p><b>a tranquil spirit >></b> Outside of battle and in places he deems safe, he lets down his guard and generally is calm, tranquil, and gentle. He loves to take naps under the shade of trees, as it reminds him of the forest he once called home. His demeanor makes it so that he is easily approachable by animals. It's not unusual to find him napping beneath a tree with a bird trying to nest in his long hair. Social cues are definitely a challenge for him  - a combo of him being raised in a remote village in Othard, being a foreigner in Eorzea (for only a time, since eventually he calls it home), and being some flavor of neurodivergent.</p>
    <p><b>introverted hero >></b> He does tend to keep to himself and honestly prefers it that way, which makes him feel very ill-suited for the more political side of things that the scions get involved with. He's just glad that the others are there to do the talking, as he would rather be pointed as a weapon toward the enemy instead.</p>
    <p><b>frosted bloodlust >></b> During battle, it would be a wonder to get any words out of him if you were his enemy. His attitude becomes one of frostbite - silent and poised to kill. Underneath the calm, he has a thirst for battle and bloodshed that can be rather frightening to others, even his comrades. His guilty pleasure is the thrill of dancing with death - nothing makes him feel both more alive and more appreciative of the world around him, and it makes him more protective of life as a whole. At one point (during Stomblood), this becomes dangerously close to a kind of self-harm, to the point that Aymeric had to stage an intervention at the behest of the Scions. At the same time, this bloodthirst is what draws Zenos towards him, and as a result he further enables that side of him. Interestingly, he does not mind being dehumanized and being used as a weapon and a weapon only, partly due to the way he was raised and his love for fighting.</p>
    <p><b>the mind of a protector >></b> Some would say that his behavior with which he readily throws himself into harm’s way for the sake of others is befitting as his role as the Warrior of Light, but when one decides to look into it a little further, the behavior quickly becomes concerning. This is both due to his yearning for battle and his belief that you must go the distance in order to protect those you love; however, he truly takes this to a drastic length to the point of near-martyrdom. His tendency to put everything and everyone before himself manifests into such behavior as a result.</p>
    <p>From a conversation regarding Rune's habits and tendencies:</p>
    <ul>T: <i>maybe just like the pattern is like jumping into things without regard if he comes out alive. like everyone knows the stakes of it all but rune knows it and just jumps anyways while everyone hesitates.</i></ul>
    <ul>A: <i>yea i think that would be a good way to go about it! like with the primals everyone is initially thinking like “oh he’s so brave for that” but when the enemies scale even further in terms of power [axilia's] like “now wait a minute. hold on there bud. did you even plan to come out of that one alive”</i></ul>
    <br><hr><br>

    <h2><section id="relationships">relationships</section></h2>
    <h3><u>the scions of the seventh dawn</u></h3>
    <p><b>axilia "axi" molkot >></b> A fellow Warrior of Light and Rune's adoptive sister and closest friend, she is the one amongst the Scions to have known him the longest after she taken in by Miounne, who was also taking care of Rune at the time. The two very much have a close sibling relationship despite their differences in race, with Axilia being a Keeper of the Moon Miqo'te. Their closeness is enough to where she is easily able to bring out a more whimsical and childish side to Rune.  Owing to their similar backgrounds, the two like to engage in their own modified Huntspeak that they have formulated on their own during their youths - enough to where they can get into entire arguments without others knowing about the subject. In battle, he can always rely on her to have his back whenever healing is concerned.</p>
    <p><b>alphinaud leveilleur >></b> Initially, Rune saw the young Elezen as rather pretentious and thus took a while for him to warm up to him. However, over time, Rune began to see him more as a younger brother to protect, even if the latter would claim - and show - time and time again that he does not need it. Rune and Alisaie occasionally gang up on him for friendly teasing, much to his chagrin.</p>
    <p><b>alisaie leveilleur >></b> Full aware is Rune regarding Alisaie’s regard towards him as a figure to look up to, but he is unable to completely comprehend as to why. As contradictory as it sounds, he cannot help but try and dissuade others from also going down the same path as he does – that is, as a warrior fighting for the star to the point where he will willingly and readily die for its sake.</p>
    <p><b>thancred waters >></b> Another member of the Scions that, initially, Rune took a while to warm up to, what with the Hyur's tendency to appear sly and silver-tongued, as well as his... <i>odd</i> relationship history with Axilia. Over time, he eventually saw the man as another warrior to be respected, and the two would become friends that would endlessly poke fun at each other - sometimes kind of violently. However, this relationship would go beyond that later on, in which Thancred becomes a sort of big brother figure that had been missing in Rune's life since Thurin's death.</p>
    <p><b>urianger augurelt >></b> Probably a member of the Scions that took longest for Rune to trust, as the former's tendency to be secretive and difficult way of speaking makes it hard for him to be understood by Rune at all. The events with the Warriors of Darkness did not help matters. Eventually, Rune would find that Urianger ultimately acts for the good of the star, and that's something that he agrees with.</p>
    <p><b>y'shtola rhul >></b> A Scion that easily and quickly won Rune's respect with her no-nonsense manner, dry wit, and keen intelligence, the two share a kind of sibling bond as well, where he can easily rely on her for both advice and scathing humor whenever it is needed. If Thancred and Rune poke fun at each other in a near-violent way, Y'shtola and Rune poke fun at each other in a psychologically and emotionally damaging kind of way.</p>
    <p><b>g'raha tia >></b> What was said with Alisaie can also be said for G'raha - yet, it's hard to try and sway this particular Miqo'te from following in his footsteps. With their initial meeting during the Crystal Tower raids, the Viera did not think much of him other than someone who was trying very hard to prove himself to others - and eventually he thought less of him after finding out about his relationship with Axilia and how it had turned out back then. He definitely did not think well of him as the Crystal Exarch with his involvement with the incredibly harrowing disappearances of his friends during a time when he needed them the most. Eventually, however, G'raha would prove himself to Rune time and time again with his capabilities as a well-rounded member of the Scions, in both battle and scholarly pursuits. Even so, their relationship is particularly rocky - something that the perceptive G'raha is unusually oblivious to.</p>
    <p><b>estinien varlineau >></b> One would think that the two least talkative members of the Scions would not get along with each other that well, and they would be wrong - in fact, the two are in some sort of relationship with Aymeric, and everybody and their mother knows about it. Despite the rocky start to their relationship whilst Rune was training as a Dragoon, the two would find trust in each other through their preferred method of communication: combat. Truly the two are a sight to behold in the battlefield, especially when fighting alongside each other; they also serve as an anchor for each other in times of need. Their penchant for silence within the Scions is also legendary,  as a single glance between the two is seemingly enough to speak a thousand words. Sometimes, however, it gets really awkward if someone else is in the room with them and said person has no idea how to break the silence.</p>
    <p>Although Rune and Estinien are rather similar to each other in terms of reticence and combat prowess, precious times where the two bonded would actually be underneath the stars, especially during their trip to Zenith to confront the dragon Hraesvelgr. This would eventually become a habit that the two share in the future. Even with Estinien's tendency to disappear at a moment's notice and to be gone for long periods of time, the bond between the two never waver - and this was how Rune learned how, back at his home, the love between Viera remain ever strong, even when they are apart from each other for years.</p>
    <p><b>minfilia warde >></b> With her involvement with Rune's induction into the Scions, Rune quickly found himself as a blade pointed by Minfilia against those that threatened the star - and, while one would think that this would be rather dehumanizing, Rune wouldn't think so, and easily assimilated himself into the role. He has much to thank her for allowing him into this strange family cobbled together by shared sentiment of protecting the star, and he would find that he can easily thank her by being a weapon when he is needed to be one.</p>
    <p><b>krile baldesion >></b> The relationship between these two are much more easily attributed as "friendly coworkers" at first, and would have stayed that way if not for Krile's ability to read emotions. While Rune is one to closely guard his inner feelings and thoughts, such feelings are still felt so powerfully within him that it's honestly hard for Krile to ignore. This compared with her tact lent her to be another person Rune found that he can confide his worries to.</p>
    <p><b>tataru taru >></b> Quickly does Rune gain some protectiveness over those that cannot engage in combat for themselves, and Tataru is one of them. The receptionist's kindheartedness and eagerness to do right by the Scions is one that he is endlessly aware and thankful for, so much that he will follow her instructions to the letter when it comes to money matters. Seven Hells hath no fury like a Tataru scorned regarding money, and even Rune knows this.</p>
    <p><b>yda / lyse hext >></b> An easy rule of thumb for Rune to warm up to others is that, the more straightforward they are, the more he likes and trusts them - and Yda is no exception to this rule. The two became fast friends after their initial meeting, especially due to the closeness in age that they have, and eventually they also became each others' preferred sparring partners. While Papalymo was able to trust that Rune wouldn’t let Yda do anything too stupid to get herself killed, he kind of… just does so anyway (and kind of eggs her on to do it actually), much to the Lalafell’s displeasure. She definitely and easily brings out a more childish side in Rune, where normally the only other person able to do so with such ease would be Axilia.</p>
    <p><b>papalymo totolymo >></b> If Papalymo's relationship with Yda can be summarized as teacher and student, Rune would have been the student that would have made Yda's antics worse and the two would have been forced to sit in different parts of the classroom. That, however, is not to say that Rune does not respect him - far from it, actually. What lessons he learned about the world around him are ones that he would cherish, especially after the former's valiant death whilst confining Shinryu to buy time for the Scions.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><u>others outside the scions</u></h3>
    <p><b>haurchefant greystone >></b> In the Scions' direst hour, he was there to help them, and to Rune, there could be no greater show of friendship than this. While Haurchefant remained as one of his staunchest allies, he also became, in time, one of his greatest regrets, one that he wrestles with to this day. If asked, Rune would rather face down thousands of primals at once rather than break the news of Haurchefant's death to Count Edmont again.</p>
    <p><b>aymeric de borel >></b> Initially did the Lord Commander come off as unreadable to Rune, and only saw him as another leader that came to the Scions for political reasons - and, with Rune's track record of avoiding speaking where politics were concerned, there is not much interest to be had there, and would end up leaving Alphinaud to do much of the conversing when it is needed. Over time did he prove himself to be another leader worthy of respect during the fight against the Dravanian Horde at the Steps of Faith. While Haurchefant provided the Scions with aid after the Bloody Banquet, it was Aymeric that made their entry into Ishgard possible at all - and while Rune had some reservations about such a move being used as a possible form of debt in the future, it was one that he graciously accepted due to the direness of the situation at the time. All of this is to say that their relationship did not start off as well as others may think, which may come as a surprise, considering how badly the two hide their affections for each other now.</p>
    <p>Between the two of them, Rune was definitely the icier one in the beginning, but would prove to Aymeric over and over again his devotion to the star by acting as a weapon for Ishgard even though he was not of the nation. Such acts of devotion in turn would cause Aymeric to become more open in his admiration and confidence in Rune, which would then translate into more straightforwardness that the Viera would receive - and highly prefer over the gymnastics of politics. It was to the surprise of Rune when he found just how close he had become to Aymeric when, at one point, the Elezen confided in him his laments regarding his relationship with father, and Rune found himself thinking that he would easily kill Thordan for him if need be (and in Rune's eyes, there was no greater act of devotion than killing for the sake of someone else).</p>
    <p>This relationship of theirs would later bleed into Rune's relationship with Estinien - and, by virtue of Aymeric's relationship with Estinien as well, it all turns into a sort of throuple/polycule/queerplatonic relationship/what have you. If anyone asked them how to define it, the three involved wouldn't even know how to describe it - just that they all care for each other very, very much, more so than normal.</p>
    <p><b>zenos yae galvus >></b> The relationship these two share is very convoluted and complicated, with the only point holding them together being that of ultraviolence. Their personalities are two different kinds of cold and yet they clash all the same; Rune’s underlying heart is bathed in protective fury and Zenos’s is wrapped in hedonistic masochism. None of their encounters seem romantic either, at least to outsiders, and yet in some kind of sick way, Rune is the only one able to understand Zenos and how he ticks and Zenos with Rune.</p>
    <p>Where Aymeric and Estinien try to pull Rune back from the abyss that comes with his concerning enthusiasm regarding dancing with death, Zenos pulls him in further and ruins any kind of progress they may have made. (This is also what separates Rune from Zenos in terms of their similarities with their bloodlust - Rune has a support system and Zenos doesn’t. Because of that, it’s all Zenos knows, and why he continues to enable Rune’s behavior.) It’s not that Rune easily allows him to do so either; it’s something the Viera thoroughly despises him for and actively fights against for the sake of his loved ones. And yet, Zenos makes it too easy to fall back on bad habits.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, Rune also enables Zenos's behavior by simply existing. To the crown prince, Rune was his “angel” that “came to bring him love (aka unfettered and unrestrained violence and the thrill that comes with such adversity)” and he wants nothing more than it. The Viera becomes a sort of obsession for him, making him spiral down further into his own web of destruction; for prior to meeting Rune, his life was stagnant and he was unable to find the satisfaction he so craved in the war that comes with living. It probably wouldn't even come as a surprise if he ended up mistaking his obsession as love at some point. What kind of love, though, is anyone's guess. After all, what wouldn't he do for the one that brought color to his world, even if that color happened to be a deep scarlet?</p>
    <p>Overall, it’s a relationship deeply entrenched in their violent vices. It’s the only kind of language that they are able to speak to each other with, after all. There’s no flowers to be shared here, or for romantic songs to be sung. These two just really want to kill each other and somehow the “do you think love can bloom on a battlefield” quote applies here.</p>
    <p><b>adra >></b> A voidsent that Rune makes a pact with after the events in the First, they work in tandem with him as he learns to harness his abilities as a Reaper. The only time that they truly appear to others is when Rune is Enshrouded and they take over for a short time - other than that, they do not appear much when others are around. They mainly serve as his tether to the darkness after his experiences in the First, in which such experiences have left him shaken in regards to his connection with the Light. Their bargain was struck out of Rune's secret fear of being unable to maintain a balance of both Light, and running the risk of falling prey to either as a result.</p>
    <p><b>erenville >></b> Recall the rule of straightforwardness with Rune, and Erenville would certainly win the contest (if there even was one). It's with this particular Viera that Rune encounters some sort of schoolboy-like crush (for probably the first time in his life) during his time in Old Sharlayan (which is kind of funny, considering that Old Sharlayan is basically a Big College Nation) simply because he's pretty and he really liked his personality. He is also ironically terrible at hiding this due to his inexperience with such feelings, to which Axilia and Krile are Too Aware of his feelings as a result. This would prove a humorous detriment during their forays into Tural with Wuk Lamat and company, where Axilia would constantly try to set up ways to get Rune to confess to him, and where the latter would easily rather die than do so.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><u>biological family</u></h3>
    <p><b>thurin >></b> Rune's older brother by ten years and the one who had trained him for a short while as a Wood Warder before his untimely death at the hands of Garleans. The two were not particularly close due to their age gap. In a both hilarious and sad fashion, Rune never truly realized that he was related to Thurin at all due to this age gap and with Thurin opting to not say anything about their familial relationship for the sole assumption that "he thought he knew". This fact would unfortunately be taken to his grave.</p>
    <p>His body was found by another Warder not long after the Garlean attack to their camp and was subsequently returned to the village, where Katja held last rites for both of her sons, under the assumption that both were dead.</p>
    <p><b>joryck >></b> Rune's father and the spitting image of Thurin. Once known throughout the village for his combat prowess and many, many years of Warder experience under his belt, Joryck was Thurin and Rune's father and was also well-known for his kind eyes. Joryck was presumed deceased after failing to return to the village after a decade and five years of no contact, where male Viera were expected to return every three to five years. No evidence of his death, however, has been found.</p>
    <p>In truth, Joryck is indeed dead, and was killed by the hands of an aether-starved voidsent — and one that also happens to serve as Rune's Avatar now.</p>
    <p><b>katja >></b> Rune's mother and his sole surviving relative, who remains unaware to this day that he is alive and well after the assumption was made that Rune had died with Thurin. With Rune unable to recall exactly where he came from, it's highly unlikely that she will ever know that he lives.</p>
    <p>If Thurin was the mirror image of Joryck, then Rune is the mirror image of Katja.</p>
